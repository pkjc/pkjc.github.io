    <p>I don’t find myself defined by the work I’ve done. I define myself by the work I want to do.</p>
    <p>I believe skills can be taught—personality is inherent. My personality is what separates me from others. Rather than getting awards, advancing status, or gaining accolades, I prefer to keep learning, continue challenging myself, and do <a href="work" data-no-turbolink="true">interesting things</a> that matter.</p>
    <p>I’m the cumulation of many skills and talents. I’m wisdom, creativity, and experience. I’m not a collection of hours. I’ve stopped seeing myself as a per-hour commodity.</p>
    <p>I work with clients who want results and invest in their business in order to make it profitable. The value of what I do is based on the impact I can have on my client’s business.</p>
    <p>I am currently <a href="mailto:alex@alexcican.com" title="Email me">available for hire.</a></p>
